# myKEY #

You will need a myKEY to enrol and to access Compensation Web Applications, access your pay stubs, encrypt documents on your desktop, send and receive encrypted email messages and securely connect to the Government of Canada’s Secure Remote Access. The myKEY program enhances the online security of communications and transactions by and between Government of Canada employees. 

## How to get a myKEY ##

If you do not have a myKEY, or if yours has expired or become inactive (which happens when you do not use it for several months), you can:
- use the [Online Registration and Credential Administration (ORCA)](https://eajl-orca.securise-secure.gc.ca/O/vw/bienvenue-welcome-eng.pub) system to manage your myKEY

If an LRA created your myKEY, you can import it into ORCA. This will let you use ORCA to perform your own recovery if you forget your password or your myKEY expires.

To begin in ORCA, click on “[myKEY sign up](https://eajl-orca.securise-secure.gc.ca/O/vw/bienvenue-welcome-eng.pub)”.

2. If you do not have an Entrust profile and are a new user, sign-up and provide your personal information, such as name, email, address, personal identification number (PRI) and date of birth.
