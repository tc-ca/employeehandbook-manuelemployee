# Setting up pay #

## Pay forms ##
When you first start, you should have received an email from TC from express lane staff with appropriate pay forms to fill out. If you did not receive the forms, they can be found here.

As a new employee, you will not have received a Personal Record Identifier (PRI) or employee number so those fields can be left blank.

You will need to fill out **all** mandatory forms below:

1. New Employee Questionnaire (Form: 10-0011)
2. The employment summary information on page two of the New Employee Questionnaire will be used to determine vacation leave and severance pay entitlements. Please complete this information on your form.
3. Direct Deposit Enrolment Request (PWGSC)
4. Federal Personal Tax Credits Return - TD1 (CRA)
5. Provincial Tax Credits Return Form (based on your province of work)
* Provincial Tax Credits Return TD1 (prov) - all provinces except Quebec
* Quebec - Source Deductions Return form (TP-1015.3)

You will need to fax or scan and email the documents to:

**Fax or email all completed forms to Compensation APRBC at (613) 991-6512.**

Once you have submitted these forms, you will receive an automated email from Compensation Ops to let you know the items have been received.

Once Compensation Ops has processed your submitted paperwork (generally around 10 business days), you will receive another email from Compensation Ops stating the date of your first payment, and PRI#. 

You will also receive information on how to sign up for a MyKey (which you can't do without a PRI#) which will allow you to view your paystub. You cannot sign up for a MyKey or view your paystub until the date of your first payment.
